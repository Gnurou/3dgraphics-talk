Slides for a 3D talk featuring WebGL to illustrate how 3D graphics are rendered. Still needs tuning.

And I really need to learn how to do proper Javascript.

You can view it online, although some slides are not rendered correctly that way:

How to sync for offline use:

    git clone https://github.com/Gnurou/3dgraphics-talk.git
    cd 3dgraphics-talk
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Then open index.html in Firefox (only Firefox renders this properly for now). Use enter or right to progress. Space allows you to skip whole slides that feature animations.

Projects used:
* Reveal.js
* Three.js
* Raphael.js
* Tween.js
